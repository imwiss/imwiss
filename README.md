Hi 👋 ! My name is Wissam and I'm an Engineering Manager at Stripe where I get to build public APIs that power the economic infrastructure for the internet. Previously, I was an Engineering Manager at GitHub leading a team responsible for GitHub's global scale public APIs ([REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) & [GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)). I've had the privilege of working remotely full-time for 6 years now, including at two pioneers of the remote industry: GitHub and InVision. This has helped shape my thoughts and philosophy on scaling engineering organizations and managing remote teams. I focus on increasing impact in distributed organizations by fostering strong engineering cultures.

More to come here shortly... 🕐
